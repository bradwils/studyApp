# UI Design Ideas & To-Do Items

## Pause/Break Button Design
- [ ] Change break to just one button for pause
- [ ] Use that button to pause timer
- [ ] Implement logic: pause < 5 minutes = break
- [ ] Pause duration >= 5 minutes should be handled differently

## Pause Screen Experience
- [ ] Pause should be a big deal - a major screen change
- [ ] Design a clear visual indicator that you're very clearly not studying
- [ ] Consider full-screen overlay or dedicated pause mode view
- [ ] Add prominent "Resume" button to return to studying

## General Screen Design
- [ ] General screen design needs inspiration since idk rn
- [ ] Research study app UI patterns and best practices
- [ ] Consider color schemes and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Think about minimizing distractions during study mode

## Leaderboard Feature
- [ ] Maybe slider for other friends' study hours from bottom (leaderboard)
- [ ] Consider bottom sheet or slide-up panel design
- [ ] Display friends' study hours in an engaging way
- [ ] Make it easy to dismiss to stay focused

## UI Inspiration Sketching
- [ ] Do UI inspo sketching
- [ ] Create rough mockups for pause screen
- [ ] Sketch leaderboard slider concept
- [ ] Explore different timer/pause button layouts
- [ ] Consider accessibility and one-handed use

## Media Player Integration
- [ ] Add media player at the top of the screen (similar to Waze)
- [ ] Display currently playing music information:
  - Song name
  - Artist name
  - Album cover thumbnail
- [ ] Include a progress bar across the entire width of the screen
  - Shows current playback position
  - Visual indicator of how far through the song
- [ ] Consider adding basic music controls (play/pause, skip)
  - Keep it minimal to avoid distraction
  - Optional: may not include controls to maintain focus

## Notes
These ideas were captured while on mobile. Prioritize implementing the pause functionality first, as it's a core feature that impacts the user experience during study sessions.
