SwiftUI agent

# My Agent

Describe what your agent does here...
Always use native Swift / SwiftUI functions, and combine where neseccary. Make sure implementations are smooth, look good, and visually pleasing, as that's always the goal with the app.
Make sure you document where relevant, how things work, but not obvious things like padding or basic layout. Explain as if the user is still new to SwiftUI and will always be a little bit behind what's being implemented.
